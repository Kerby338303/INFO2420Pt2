<p>Welcome to Rent A Pet. This page explains how our pet rental business began,
how it has grown, and what makes us different from other pet services.</p>

<h2 id="beginning">In the Beginning</h2>
<p>Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs.  George Smith and his wife Carol owned two Irish Setters.  These dogs were pets to the Smith family children and extended family members.  One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how they attracted the attention of passing women.  They seemed to like to stop what they were doing and ask him about his dogs.

fit perfectly into their busy lives.</p>
<p>The company continues to expand its offerings by adding cats, horses, pigs,
and even snakes for customers who want a more unusual pet experience.</p>

<h2 id="unique">What Makes Us Unique</h2>
<p>Rent A Pet has expanded from its early location in Provo and now serves
customers in several surrounding communities. Dogs are carefully trained for
good manners, and horses are selected for calm, friendly temperaments. The staff
works hard to match each renter with a pet that fits his or her lifestyle.</p>

<p>Because Rent A Pet owns the animals, the company can keep them healthy and

weekend adventures, or special events.</p>
