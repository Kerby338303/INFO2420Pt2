<h1>About Rent A Pet</h1>

<p>Welcome to Rent A Pet. This page explains how our pet rental business began,
how it has grown, and what makes us different from other pet services.</p>

<h2>In the Beginning</h2>

     class="img-left" width="250" height="160">

<p>Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs.  George Smith and his wife Carol owned two Irish Setters.  These dogs were pets to the Smith family children and extended family members.  One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how they attracted the attention of passing women.  They seemed to like to stop what they were doing and ask him about his dogs.  A young woman remarked that she would love to have a big dog like that to walk, but she had a small apartment and couldn't keep a large dog.  This brief encounter was the beginning of an idea.  What if there were others, possible many others, who wanted companionship of pets without the responsibility?  Maybe people would be willing to pay to rent or borrow a pet for a short period of time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>George shared his idea with Carol and they began to look at the pros and cons related to start a small business that would rent dogs for a day.  Some of the advantages of this kind of business would be:</p>

<h2>Where We Are Today</h2>

<p>After weighing the advantages and disadvantages, the Smith family moved
forward with the Rent A Pet idea and opened a small location in Provo. The
business has grown as more people discover that a short-term pet companion can
fit perfectly into their busy lives.</p>

<p>The company continues to expand its offerings by adding cats, horses, pigs,
and even snakes for customers who want a more unusual pet experience.</p>

<h2>Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>

<h3>Advantages for Renters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Access to a pet on a schedule that works for them.</li>
  <li>Ability to choose the type of pet they prefer.</li>
  <li>Exercise and companionship without long–term responsibility.</li>
  <li>No ongoing food, housing, or medical costs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Responsibilities for the Business</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Providing clean and safe housing and feeding for the animals.</li>
  <li>Covering routine and emergency medical expenses.</li>
  <li>Maintaining liability insurance and proper licensing.</li>
  <li>Spending time each day caring for, training, and socializing the pets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Makes Us Unique</h2>

<p>Rent A Pet has expanded from its early location in Provo and now serves
customers in several surrounding communities. Dogs are carefully trained for
good manners, and horses are selected for calm, friendly temperaments. The staff
works hard to match each renter with a pet that fits his or her lifestyle.</p>

<p>Because Rent A Pet owns the animals, the company can keep them healthy and
well trained while still giving customers flexible rental options for vacations,
weekend adventures, or special events.</p>
